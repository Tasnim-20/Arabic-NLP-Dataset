**Content Overview:**

**Data Overview:** Explore data sources, variable descriptions, and descriptive statistics. 

**Data Exploration and Analysis:**

Data Preprocessing: Clean data, remove stop words, and normalize text through stemming and lemmatization. 

Text Vectorization: Utilize TF-IDF matrices and word count vectorization. 

Dimensionality Reduction: Employ PCA for dimensionality reduction, interpreting components, and visualizing data. 

Modeling and Classification: Apply clustering techniques (K-means, KNN), assess performance with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves, and implement classification models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) for nonlinear modeling
